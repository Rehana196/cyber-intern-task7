The objective of this task was to learn to spot and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions to enhance browser security.

### Objective
he objective of this task was to learn to spot and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions to enhance browser security.

### 1. Steps Taken
To complete this task, I followed the provided guide:

1.  **Opened Manager:** I accessed my browser's extension manager (`chrome://extensions`) to see all installed extensions.
2.  **Reviewed Extensions:** I carefully reviewed each installed extension: `Google Docs Offline`, `McAfee WebAdvisor`, and `PDF Viewer`.
3.  **Checked Permissions:** I analyzed the permissions for each extension to see what data they could access.
4. **Identified Suspicious Extension:** I identified one extension (`PDF Viewer`) as suspicious due to its excessive and unnecessary permissions.
5.  **Removed Extension:** I removed the suspicious extension to secure my browser. The other extensions were deemed safe and were kept.
6.  **Documented Findings:** I have documented the specific extensions found and the reasons for removal in this report.

### 2. Analysis of Installed Extensions

I audited all extensions installed on my browser. Here is a list and the action taken for each.

#### Removed Extensions
* **Extension Name:** `PDF Viewer`
    * **Reason for Removal:** This extension was identified as **highly suspicious** and removed.
    * **Analysis:** While it claimed to just display PDF files, it required dangerous permissions: **"Read your browsing history"** and **"Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites that you visit."** A simple PDF viewer has no legitimate need for this level of access. These permissions would allow it to steal passwords, inject ads, or track all user activity. Furthermore, modern browsers have a secure, built-in PDF viewer, making this extension redundant.

#### Safe Extensions (Kept)
* **Extension Name:** `McAfee WebAdvisor`
    * **Reason for Keeping:** This is a legitimate extension from a well-known cybersecurity company (McAfee).
    * **Analysis:** Although it asks for high-level permissions ("Read and change all your data"), these are **necessary for its intended function**. It needs this access to scan websites for malware, block phishing attempts, and protect the user, so the permissions are justified.

* **Extension Name:** `Google Docs Offline`
    * **Reason for Keeping:** This is an official, safe extension provided by Google.
    * **Analysis:** Its permissions are appropriate for its function, which is to allow access to Google Docs, Sheets, etc., without an internet connection.
